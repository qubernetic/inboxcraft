## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Repository structure, project documents and contribution rules.
- Development container and justfile (#1)
- Cargo workspace with every crate of the architecture as an empty skeleton, and the first `cargo xtask` gates:
  `ci`, `spdx [--fix]` and `test-files` (#5)
- `cargo xtask` gates `layers` (the crate layering table in `xtask/src/layers.rs`), `wasm`, `assets` and `stats`,
  all part of `cargo xtask ci` (#6)
- `cargo xtask cov [--check]`: line coverage per crate under `cargo llvm-cov nextest`, checked against the
  floors in `.config/coverage.toml` (95 % workspace, 98 % core crates, 80 % `net` and `ui-egui`); part of
  `cargo xtask ci`, and `just cov` runs it (#7)
- `inboxcraft-testkit`, the dev-only fake server frame: a scripted line-protocol server on a loopback port over
  plain TCP or implicit TLS, a fault script (drop, delay, garbage), a test CA generated at test time, the
  certificate faults (unknown CA, expired, wrong host name, client clock far off) and a test client that reports
  each fault as its own error kind; 98 % coverage floor (#8)
- Opt-in live tests on two throwaway test accounts, run by the owner alone with `just it-live`: the
  `inboxcraft-testkit` `live` module reads `INBOXCRAFT_LIVE_*` and skips with its reason printed without them
  (always in the agent sandbox and in CI), enforces the recipient allow-list of the two run-time addresses, names
  the accounts `live-imap` and `live-google` in output, redacts secrets and creates and removes the per-run folder
  `InboxCraft-Test/<run id>`; nextest profile `live`; `just it-live` reads the credentials from the OS credential
  store for that run only and fails when a secret value appears in the test output (#10)
