## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Repository structure, project documents and contribution rules.
- Development container and justfile (#1)
- Cargo workspace with every crate of the architecture as an empty skeleton, and the first `cargo xtask` gates:
  `ci`, `spdx [--fix]` and `test-files` (#5)
- `cargo xtask` gates `layers` (the crate layering table in `xtask/src/layers.rs`), `wasm`, `assets` and `stats`,
  all part of `cargo xtask ci` (#6)
- `cargo xtask cov [--check]`: line coverage per crate under `cargo llvm-cov nextest`, checked against the
  floors in `.config/coverage.toml` (95 % workspace, 98 % core crates, 80 % `net` and `ui-egui`); part of
  `cargo xtask ci`, and `just cov` runs it (#7)
- `inboxcraft-testkit`, the dev-only fake server frame: a scripted line-protocol server on a loopback port over
  plain TCP or implicit TLS, a fault script (drop, delay, garbage), a test CA generated at test time, the
  certificate faults (unknown CA, expired, wrong host name, client clock far off) and a test client that reports
  each fault as its own error kind; 98 % coverage floor (#8)
- Opt-in live tests on two throwaway test accounts, run by the owner alone with `just it-live`: the
  `inboxcraft-testkit` `live` module reads `INBOXCRAFT_LIVE_*` and skips with its reason printed without them
  (always in the agent sandbox and in CI), enforces the recipient allow-list of the two run-time addresses (plain
  dot-atom addresses only), names the accounts `live-imap` and `live-google` in output, redacts secrets and
  creates and removes the per-run folder `InboxCraft-Test/<run id>` and no other; nextest profile `live`;
  `just it-live` builds the live test archive first, reads the credentials from the OS credential store for the
  run from that archive only, passes on test name filters but no options, and fails when a secret, an address or a
  login name appears in the test output (#10)
- `inboxcraft-time`: the injectable `Clock` with `SystemClock` (the browser's clock on wasm) and `FakeClock`, the
  only clock tests use; `Timestamp` (years 0 to 10000), civil dates, weekdays and fixed offsets; `MailDate` reads
  and writes RFC 5322 dates, the obsolete forms of section 4.3 included (comments, two- and three-digit years,
  zone names, military zones and unknown names as `-0000`), refusing input over 998 bytes or comments nested
  deeper than 16; property tests and the first fuzz target, `fuzz/fuzz_targets/rfc5322_date.rs` (#15)
