B = blocks the next stage.

## Known rough edges (not ranked)
- Every crate is an empty skeleton; the apps answer `--version` and refuse everything else (#5).
- The `ui-egui` drawing code is not left out of the workspace coverage total yet: there is none. Its files join
  `workspace-exclude` in `.config/coverage.toml` when it lands (#7).
- The app crates have no coverage floor of their own; their `main` counts only for its crate, which has none (#7).
- `cargo xtask ci` runs the tests twice, once under nextest and once under `cargo llvm-cov nextest` for the
  coverage gate (#7).
- The `justfile` has no `assets` and `stats` recipes; they run as part of `just ci` (#6).
- `cargo xtask layers` checks direct dependencies only, and knows network and UI crates by name from two lists in
  `xtask/src/layers.rs`; a crate missing from them is not caught (#6).
- `cargo xtask stats` counts files and lines; the number of commands in the registry comes once the registry
  exists (#6).
- `cargo xtask test-files` reads lines, not a syntax tree: a module line inside a multi-line string counts as a
  module (#5).
